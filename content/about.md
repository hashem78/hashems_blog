My father had a PC in 2003 - this was huge. 

Me being a lone 3yo child had the privilege to wreck havoc on my father's computer, I'd mess with the wrong settings option, delete a desktop shortcut, change the color of the display, or do some weird shenanigans. My father was unexperienced with computers and perhaps a bit naive; he'd physically take the PC to a repair shop 30KM away from where we lived to have some simple option turned on/off for an exorbitant fee, one day he decided enough was enough and bought a slew of books and started studying the damn thing to get away from having to pay $100 every time I glanced the wrong way towards his computer, he eventually did a 180 degree career shift and landed an IT position at a prestigious company.

Growing up, my father fed me the wealth of knowledge he gained working with computers, and I loved every bit of it, in fact that decision he made all those years ago influenced me so much that I pursued Computer Engineering for my bachelors degree at the Jordanian University of Science and Technology, as of 13/9/2022 I awaiting to take up my last few credits for graduation.

I am interested in all things programming and tech.

- Backend development.
- Mobile applications.
- Compiler design and development.
- Operating Systems design and development.
- Game engines.
- Blockchain technology.
- Cameras and optics in general.
- EVs.

Are some of the things I like to work on and think about.
